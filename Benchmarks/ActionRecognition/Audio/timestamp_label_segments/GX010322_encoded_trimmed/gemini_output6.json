"Please provide the audio recording.  I need the audio file to perform the transcription and analysis as requested.  I cannot process audio from a text description. Once you provide the audio, I will follow the steps:\n\n1. **Speech Recognition:** I will use a speech-to-text engine to transcribe the audio.  This will likely generate a raw transcript containing irrelevant information.\n\n2. **Transcript Cleaning:** I will manually review the transcript and remove all utterances unrelated to the first responders' interventions to save the patient. This includes removing greetings, irrelevant conversations, background noise descriptions, etc.  Only actions and statements directly related to patient care will be retained.\n\n3. **JSON Output:** Finally, I will format the cleaned transcript into a JSON array as requested: `[\"transcript\"]`, where \"transcript\" contains the relevant text.  If there is no audio or the audio is uninterpretable, the output will be `[\"None\"]`.\n"
