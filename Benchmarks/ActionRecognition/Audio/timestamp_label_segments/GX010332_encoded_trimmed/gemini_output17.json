"Please provide the audio recording.  I need the audio file to perform the transcription and analysis as requested.  I cannot process an audio file without it being provided.  Once you provide the audio, I will follow the steps outlined:\n\n1. **Speech Recognition:** I will use a speech-to-text engine to transcribe the audio.\n2. **Transcript Cleaning:** I will manually review the transcript to remove irrelevant conversations, focusing solely on the first responder's interventions to save the patient.\n3. **JSON Output:** I will format the cleaned transcript in JSON as requested: `[\"transcript\"]`.  If no audio is provided (or if the audio contains no relevant information), the output will be `[\"None\"]`.\n"
