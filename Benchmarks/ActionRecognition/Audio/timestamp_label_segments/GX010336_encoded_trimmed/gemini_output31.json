"Please provide the audio recording.  I need the audio file to perform the transcription and analysis as requested.  I cannot process audio from a text description. Once you provide the audio, I will follow the steps:\n\n1. **Speech Recognition:** I will use a speech-to-text engine to transcribe the audio.  (Note:  The accuracy of this step depends heavily on the audio quality.)\n\n2. **Irrelevant Utterance Removal & Error Correction:** I will manually review the transcript to remove irrelevant conversations (e.g., EMS chatter unrelated to patient care, bystander comments not directly relevant to treatment) and correct any errors introduced by the speech recognition engine.\n\n3. **JSON Output:**  Finally, I will format the cleaned transcript as a JSON array: `[\"transcript\"]` where \"transcript\" contains only the relevant medical intervention details. If no audio is provided, the output will be `[\"None\"]`.\n"
