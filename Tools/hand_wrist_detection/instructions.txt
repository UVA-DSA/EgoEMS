Detecting the wrist position of the hands

Detecting hands

Use grounding dino. 
Code: https://github.com/sleekEagle/CPR-quality/blob/main/data_prep/detect_hands.py
The methods in this code can return the bounding box coordinates of the hand

Detect wrist
Use google mediapipe to detect wrist coordinates
Code: 
https://github.com/sleekEagle/CPR-quality/blob/main/data_prep/detect_keypts.py

Use the class WristDet_mediapipe to do this
Look at the function called detect_kypts_mp() on how to use this class to detect wrist position. 
You have to first crop the image with the coordinates given by grounding DINO. Then use the WristDet_mediapipe class
